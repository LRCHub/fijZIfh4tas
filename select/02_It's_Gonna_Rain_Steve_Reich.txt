He began to warn the people. He said:
"After a while,
It's gonna rain after a while; for forty days and for forty nights"
And the people didn't believe him
And they begin to laugh at him
And they begin to mock him
And they begin to say:
"It ain't gonna rain!"
It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
It's gon'
It's
Rain
They didn't believe it was gonna rain
But glory to God
Hallelujah! Bless God's wonderful name this evening
I said, this evening
After a while, they didn't believe it was gonna rain
But sure enough, it began to rain
Hallelujah! They began to knock upon the door
But it was too late
Hoo! The Bible tell me,
They knocked upon the door until the skin came off their hands
Whoo! My Lord! My Lord! I say, until the skin came off their hand
They cried
I can just hear their cry now
I can hear 'em say:
"Oh Noah! Would you just open the door?
" But Noah couldn't open the door;
It had been sealed by the hand of God
Glory to God
God
Had been sealed
Couldn't open the door
Oh Noah!
They cried
Just open the door
Couldn't open the door
But sure enough
Hallelujah!
