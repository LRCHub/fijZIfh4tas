Broken windows and empty hallways
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to give love away
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Lonely,
Lonely
Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way to treat a friend

Morning sun rising on an empty afternoon
No surprise, river rising faces, I watched you
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain, raaaaain today

Bright before me the signs implore me
To help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today
