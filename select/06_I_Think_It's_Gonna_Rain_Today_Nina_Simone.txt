Broken windows and empty hallways
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen faces to keep love away
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet, I think I'll kick it down the street
Tin can at my feet, I think I'll kick it down the street, why not?
That is the way to treat a friend

Bright before me, the signs implore me
Help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

I hope it's going to rain today, yeah
I hope it's going to rain today, yeah
I think it's going to rain today, yeah
