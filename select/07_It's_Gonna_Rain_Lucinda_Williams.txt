I'm so tired of these overcast skies
I'm so tired of the looks in people's eyes
I can't wait 'til I can go away
And it's gonna rain again today

Don't know why I'm still hangin' round
All these nightclubs only get me down
And this was never my town anyway
And it's gonna rain again today

It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain again today

I've been standin' on the edge of darkness
I can see black clouds overhead
This town is never gonna change it's ways
And it's gonna rain again today

You wanna know why I don't hang out
You wanna know what it's all about
There is nothin' much left for me to say
'Cept it's gonna rain again today

It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain again today

It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain
It's gonna rain again today
It's gonna rain again today
