Hear how the wind begins to whisper
See how the leaves go streaming by
Smell how the velvet rain is falling
Out where the fields are warm and dry

Now is the time to run inside and stay
Now is the time to find a hideaway
Where we can play

Soon it's gonna rain, I can see it
Soon it's gonna rain, I can tell
Soon it's gonna rain, what are we gonna do?

Soon it's gonna rain, I can feel it
Soon it's gonna rain, I can tell
Soon it's gonna rain, what will we do with you?

We'll find four limbs of a tree
We'll build four walls and a floor
We'll bind it over with leaves
Then duck inside and play

Then we'll let it rain, we'll not feel it
Then we'll let it rain, rain pell mall
And we'll not complain if it never stops at all
We'll live and love within our castle
Hear how the wind begins to whisper
Feel how the rain is falling now
