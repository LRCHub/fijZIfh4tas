Broken Windows And Empty Hallways
A Pale Dead Moon In The Sky Streaked With Gray
Human Kindness Is Overflowing
And I Think It's Going To Rain Today
Scarecrows Dressed In The Latest Styles
With Frozen Smiles To Chase Love Away
Human Kindness Is Overflowing
And I Think It's Going To Rain Today
Lonely, Lonely
Tin Can At My Feet
Think I'll Kick It Down The Street
That's The Way To Treat A Friend
Bright Before Me The Signs Implore Me
To Help The Needy And Show Them The Way
Human Kindness Is Overflowing
And I Think It's Going To Rain Today
