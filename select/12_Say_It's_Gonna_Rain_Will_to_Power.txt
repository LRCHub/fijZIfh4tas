You say it's gonna rain and no one's going to go out tonight
You say it's gonna rain that's why I hope you hold me tight
If I only live my life for you
There's only one thing I'd like to do
So I'm hoping you give me this chance
So tonight let us start our romance
You say it's gonna rain and no one's going to go out tonight
You know it's gonna rain that's why I hope you hold me tight
If you only have eyes just for me
Close them tight and I'm sure you will see
That nothing can stand in our way
It can happen to use any day
You say it's gonna rain and no one's going to go out tonight
I know it's gonna rain that's why I hope you hold me tight
If I only have one wish come true
I will spend my whole lifetime with you
In the dark of the night I can see
That this storm is about to be free
You say it's gonna rain and no one's going to go out tonight
You know it's gonna rain that's why I hope you hold me tight
You say it's gonna rain and no one's going to go out tonight
Rain down on me, Rain down on me
Let your love rain down on me
Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain Rain

Gonna Rain Gonna Rain
Rain, it's gonna rain, rain
Gonna Rain Gonna Rain
You say it's gonna rain and no one's going to go out tonight
You say it's gonna rain that's why I hope you hold me tight
